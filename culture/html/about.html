      <h3>Our project</h3>
      <p>Dear reader,</p>
      <p>
        in these lines we would like to tell you about Mapx, a project born in
        2016 at the crossroads of two cultures. A Russian girl and an Italian
        guy in the room of a flat in Passau (Germany) decide to combine the
        useful with the amusing, giving birth to abandonedme, our first blog of
        abandoned places. The project developed over the years in parallel with
        our travels in order to share our every emotion, exploration and
        adventure around the globe. We visit and document unexplored, off-road
        places, learning about different ethnicities and peoples, experiencing
        unknown spaces and living by surprises. We are guided by our spirit of
        travellers without following any roads, searching for places that are
        not marked on maps. We document every abandoned place with photos,
        articles and research, bringing up forgotten pasts and stories.
      </p>

        Of all the visitors to abandoned places, we have taken inspiration from
        the ‘Mapx’, explorers featured in Andrei Tarkovsky‘s film of the
        eponymous name – 1979 and the science fiction novel ‘Picnic by the
        Roadside’ – 1972. They explore ‘shadow zones‘ with the utmost respect,
        without invasion or tampering. They are ‘guests’ and explorers of
        structures forged by the hand of man, often abandoned, in ruins,
        forgotten, desolate or made off-limits. The places they visit are
        numerous and of different types: disused industrial sites, uninhabitable
        hospitals or asylums, abandoned military installations, fallen-down
        factories, forgotten castles and monuments, uninhabited cottages, sewers
        and drains, villas and basements. They move around in groups or
        individually, what is ‘hidden’ and ‘invisible’ to the sight of any
        passer-by is for them a new treasure to discover, a new adventure to
        catapult themselves into, a new danger to confront.
